# Simply To Do V2

Simply To Do V2 is a minimalist and user-friendly to-do web application built with React, converted from the original HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project "Simply To Do." This version leverages React’s component-based architecture to improve code organization, maintainability, and performance. Try the live demo linked below!

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Updates**: React’s state management ensures that the task list is updated immediately as you interact with it.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser’s local storage, so your list remains available even after a page refresh.
